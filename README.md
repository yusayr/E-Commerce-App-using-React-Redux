# E-Commerce App using React and Firebase

## Features
- I have built this e-commerce project using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. The application allows users to browse products, view product details, browse by categories, add items to shopping cart, place orders and view order history.
- I have used Redux to manage state in the application such as Adding items to cart,viewing order details, fetching product from the fake api https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products and so on.
- I have designed the app using TailwindCSS and the App is responsive for mobile and larger devices.
- The App uses Firebase to manage user authentication.
- I have built a robust backend such that it routes the user to the sign in page in case the authentication is false.
- Additionally, I have implemented the search functionality where I have used Redux to create a searchSlice, which fetches the products based on the words entered by the user.
